[Tue Oct  2 11:32:22 2018] Assembling transcripts
You are using Cufflinks v2.2.2, which is the most recent release.
Command line:
cufflinks -o /flush3/sam079/RNAseq-POMV/Processed/Assembly/SalmonPOMV/Cufflinks/cuffmerge/ -F 0.05 -q --overhang-tolerance 200 --library-type=transfrags -A 0.0 --min-frags-per-transfrag 0 --no-5-extend -p 8 /flush3/sam079/RNAseq-POMV/Processed/Assembly/SalmonPOMV/Cufflinks/cuffmerge/tmp/mergeSam_file7Vbs0Y 
[bam_header_read] EOF marker is absent. The input is probably truncated.
[bam_header_read] invalid BAM binary header (this is not a BAM file).
File /flush3/sam079/RNAseq-POMV/Processed/Assembly/SalmonPOMV/Cufflinks/cuffmerge/tmp/mergeSam_file7Vbs0Y doesn't appear to be a valid BAM file, trying SAM...
